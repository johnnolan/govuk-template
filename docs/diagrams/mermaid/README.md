# Example mermaid files instead of structurizr

You can also opt to use mermaid files for rendering your diagrams.

The examples in this folder give a high level overview of the types you can create and probably want to have to make onboarding easier for developers.

_The examples below are taken from the book [Creating Software with Modern Diagramming Techniques - Build Better Software with Mermaid](https://pragprog.com/titles/apdiag/creating-software-with-modern-diagramming-techniques/). I highly recommend purchasing this book if you are new to Diagramming as Code._
